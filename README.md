## :page_with_curl: Overview


We Focused on a problem that we see in our communities today, where people have no time to deliver or find an organization to donate various household things to, such as clothes/resources etc.
This website will make it easier for them to donate clothes without the hassle of worrying about finding time to give it to the orgs.
