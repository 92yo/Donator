## :page_with_curl: Overview:

We Focused on a problem that we see in our communities today, where people have no time to deliver or find an organization to donate various household things to, such as clothes/resources etc.
and have been sitting on their bedroom floor for a while, so this website will make it easier for them to donate clothes without the hassle of worrying about finding time to give it to the orgs.


You can view the website app on Netlify :
